Scenario:

DataVizWiz Motors Ltd has dealerships in five UK locations, including their head office in London.
On the first day of every month a member of each branch has to submit an overall revenue figure for the previous months sales, e.g. if a figure gets submitted on the first of April, this figure represents the total sales for March.

The head office in London is the only office that has access to this data.

Problem:

The Head of Sales in the London branch wants to see a summary table containing a year to date figure for each branch so he can quickly see which branches are
going to reach their end of year target. He wants to view this data in a straight table along with a KPI for each branch.

The Head of Sales has requested that the Data Analyst in his team provide this data on their Qlik dashboard. How will the Data Analyst go about this?

Solution:

The fields that get extracted from the raw data file are:

area - the area the branch is located
record_date - the date the revenue gets submitted
sales_month - the sales month for which the revenue represents
revenue - the total monthly revenue

At a first glance the Data Analyst could simply pull the data into a straight table and use a RangeSum(Above(TOTAL SUM(revenue), 0, RowNo(TOTAL))).

However, this causes issues. The formula will be dynamic to what is in the table i.e. if any selections are made on the date, it would no longer show a cumulative figure across a range of dates.

This suggest we need to move this into the data load editor as laid out in cumulative_revenue.qvs. With this code we now have a fixed cumulative value for each month.
