Scenario:

DataVizWiz Motors Ltd has dealerships in five UK locations, including their head office in London.

Every Month each branch has to submit a final summary revenue figure in the system. The head office in London is the only office that has access to this data.

Problem:

The Head of Sales in the London branch wants to see a summary table containing a year to date figure for each branch so he can quickly see which branches are
going to reach their end of year target and he wants to view this data in a straight table along with a KPI for each branch.

The Head of Sales has requested that the Data Architect provide this data on their Qlik dashboard. How will the Data Architect go about this?
